Please understand: I don't actually know all these languages. Where possible, I ran the included test suites or compiled some example code. If I could find documentation, I included it. But basically you are on your own here.

+ [@Compare](./zip/@compare.zip) 1.8 - A diff program for DOS by Brian C Madsen.
    + @Compare works on Ascii files which are roughly similar to each other (e.g. a .PAS and its .BAK file; a document and an earlier version of the same document; or data created via double data entry.)
    + Files to be compared may be of unlimited length.
    + @Compare matches up the two files, displaying them side by side, and displaying the similarities and differences between them.
    + Equal lines are marked by an equal sign on both sides of the screen; discrepancies in similar but unequal lines are highlighted; and lines which exist in one file and which have no corresponding counterpart in the other file are displayed as such.
    + Does not work in DOSBox. If your version of DOS does not allow executable filenames starting with "@" just rename @COMPARE.EXE to COMPARE.EXE.

+ [Aida](./zip/aida.zip) v2.14-0202 - DOS System Information Tool.
    + Detects lots of hard and soft wares, including all the latest (c. 2004) technolfogy.
    + Gives you more than other infoprogs.
    + *Updated: This 16-bit program claims to detect a multitasking environment in FreeDOS 1.2 running on bare silicon and refuses to run (it does work in DosBox). Please read NOTE.TXT in the documentation for a workaround. or see tip #2 on the [TIPS](Tips.md) page*.

+ [AWS](./zip/aws.zip) - Create ascii art for your txt documentation.
    + Once you are fimilar with the controls, you can make amazing diagrams for your documentation.
    + There is a powerful ascii utility that allows you to view the ASCII code table, you can make scripts to display certain parts of the table rather than all of it.
    + This program is brillant for people who like to create DOS based text interface GUI screens and is good for drawing technical diagrams or ASCII art.
    + Freeware by Paul Burden.

    + BATSCRPT allows you to embed code from any interpreted language into a batch file - BASIC, Python, Perl, REXX etc - and execute it.
    + There is no limit to how many scripts you can put in your batch files and you can place scripts for multiple programming languages even within the same batch file!
    + BSCRIPT is a non-TSR batch file enhancer that adds abilities to a batch file, like a mini-programming language.

    + GNU GPL v2 by Francesco Zamblera 
    + Requires a 32-bit extender (e.g. CWSDPMI.EXE). FreeDOS has that built in already.
    + See /FDOS/DEVEL/FLISP/flisp.txt for documentation.
    + Other (untested) Lisp implementations include [Adler](./zip/adler.zip) and [PDLisp](./zip/pdlisp.zip).

+ [Hiew](./zip/hiew.zip) - Text/Hex viewer and editor.
    + Built-in Pentium(R) Pro assembler.

    + This is the final release of FST Modula-2. It is  no more  than  a re-packaged  release 3.5.
    + The software was not changed to reflect the new release number.
    + The  only  changes   in  this   package  are   in  the documentation; specifically, the software license  changed, as shareware registration is no longer available.
    + See \FDOS\DEVEL\MODULA2\DOC\M2DOC.TXT for documentation.

+ [Moonrock](./zip/moonrock.com) 0.5 - A BASIC-like language with several extensions.

+ [Pacific C](./zip/pacific.zip) 7.51- ANSI C compiler and IDE.
    + Freeware for noncommercial use by HI-TECH Software.
    +  Pacific C combines most of the features and power of the version 7 HI-TECH C Cross Compilers into a compact, easy to use package which will run on just about any MS-DOS based personal computer.

![Pacific](./imgs/pacific.png)

+ [Pedit](./zip/pedit.zip) 4.00 - Programming editor.
    + Similar to the FreeDOS EDIT program, but more powerful, and with many additional features for programmers.
    + It includes pop-up tables, column support, macro key, undo, copy & paste to Windows applications, long filenames, word wrap, spell checker & thesaurus (English only, as far as I can make out), HTML support, and much more.
    + Freeware by Goldshell Digital Media.
    + In the Pedit package there's a file called PEDITLGT.EXE. This is the Light version of Pedit.  It's Pedit stripped of several options.
    + The purpose for this is to offer an editor which can easily be included on rescue floppies and such.
    + The omitted options are:
        + Spell checker.
        + Thesaurus.
        + Printing through Windows.
    + The remaining functionality is the same.
    + Also includes INSPECT, a hex editor.

+ [Rational Pilot (RAP)](./zip/rap.zip) - A batch file replacement language
    + Freeware by the Summer Institute of Linguistics.
    + It is a full-featured programming language designed for building user-friendly applications from a collection of stand-alone programs.
    + It can be viewed as a replacement for MS-DOS's batch processor which offers the following added features:
        + extensive string-handling primitives,
        + structured programming constructs,
        + built-in mechanism for displaying menus and handling user's responses,
        + and a wide range of primitives for testing the state of the file system so that user-proof programs can be written.
    + A common library of RAP subroutines is also included.

+ [SmallADA](./zip/smallada.zip) - A subset of the ADA language, with an IDE.
    + Freeware for noncommercial use by George Washington University.
    + This is a compiler/interpreter for a part of the Ada language, namely the "Pascal subset" plus the Ada tasking support.
    + It is not intended ever to be a full Ada compiler, rather a vehicle for teaching, learning, and experimenting with concurrent programming.
    + The compiler is quite fast, producing P-code which is then interpreted by the interpreter.
    + The entire system runs in RAM with no disk accesses, so expect capacity to be limited. 250 statements or so can be safely accommodated.
    + The current version is not particularly robust, rather it is a preliminary step toward effective window-oriented monitoring of task execution.

![Smallada](./imgs/smallada.png)

+ [SNOBOL 4](./zip/snobol.zip) - A freeware implementation of the SNOBOL language by Gordon E Peterson II.

+ [VT Prolog](./zip/vtprolog.zip) - Very Tiny Prolog.
    + A  simple PROLOG interpreter provided to encourage experimentation with PROLOG.

+ [XLisp](./zip/xlisp.zip) 2.0 - An Object-oriented Lisp.
    + Free for noncommercial use.
    + XLISP is an experimental programming language combining some of the features of Common Lisp with an object-oriented extension capability.
    + It was implemented to allow experimentation with object-oriented programming on small computers.
