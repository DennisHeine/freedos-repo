## <a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction

This is a repository of [FreeDOS](http://www.freedos.org/)-compatible freeware and OSS software. Not "abandonware", by which I mean that you will not find formerly commercial software here that have not been explicitly made open-source or at least freeware. 

However, non-crippled shareware with a single nag screen at the beginning or end is fair game. Whether you are going to try to send money to a developer from thirty or forty years ago who could be dead by now is up to you.

Having said that, there are a lot of little utilities from a kinder, gentler age, when people would just make their stuff available without worrying about licenses. These will be regarded as public domain until someone informs me otherwise.

Source code is included wherever possible.

This is not meant to be a conclusive collection of DOS applications. These are apps that I have tested on *FreeDOS 1.2* (on bare silicon and in the *DOSBox* emulator) and that I find useful, fun or interesting. If you need something more comprehensive, try [this site](http://reimagery.com/fsfd/) or [this one](https://www.opus.co.tt/dave/indexall.htm). I am not a gamer at all, so if that is what you are looking for, well, sorry.

On a standard FreeDOS installation, Option 1 of the initial menu is

     1 - Load FreeDOS with JEMMEX, no EMS (most UMBs), max RAM free
and that is the setting under which I test these programs. I have seen graphical programs, in particular, crash all too often under EMM386 in Option 2. If one of these apps absolutely requires Expanded Memory, I will document it here.

I may also slip in a few little apps that I wrote myself. You will know them by a certain primitive look and feel :-)

## <a name="Installation"></a>To install these packages:

Download the package, transfer it to your FreeDOS system and extract the zip file to the **ROOT directory** (C:\\). 

    unzip packagename.zip -d c:\

You might be tempted to use the *DosZip Commander*, which is bundled with FreeDOS and can be called up with the command *dz*, or similar utilities. I advise against this. These packages were actually created under Linux and you may come across weird crc errors if you use *dz*. The command line works fine.

*It is important to extract these packages to the root directory!* This is different from official FreeDOS packages, wich expect to be extracted to *C:\FDOS*. There is an actual reason for this. Some of these very old programs are not relocatable: They have hardcoded paths inside them and will crash or refuse to load if you try to run them from a strange directory. I have tried really hard to stick to the FreeDOS file system and not litter your root with directories, but sometimes I simply can't. Better then, to have a single installation procedure for all my packages.

Programs that do not run directly from *c:\FDOS\BIN* will have a convenient batch file placed in *C:\FDOS\LINKS*. If a program requires changes to *CONFIG.SYS* or *AUTOEXEC.BAT*, that will be documented here. 

Sorry, there is no uninstall facility. But most of these packages consist of a single directory in C:\FDOS\PROGS (or C:\FDOS\DEVEL), a batch file in C:\FDOS\LINKS and an information file in C:\FDOS\APPINFO, so it shouldn't be too hard.

## <a name="Launchers"></a>Program launchers and environments
+ [LCARS24](./zip/LCARS24.zip) - Emulates the look and feel of a certain well-known science fiction computer system.
    + Get your sound card working before you install this.
    + Originally from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lcars24/).
    + GPL v2, source included.

## <a name="Productivity"></a>Productivity applications

+ [ABBREVV](./zip/abbrevv.zip) - A  menu-oriented DOS application to view and maintain a  list  of
abbrevations.
    + Freeware by J R Ferguson for non-commercial purposes.
    + Acronyms may be up to 7 characters long, the description can be any text up to 69 characters.
    + It shows one or more sorted abbrevation lists, allows you to insert, change or delete entries and search for duplicates. 
    + You can also merge two or more abbrevation lists into  a  single  one.
    + The  program  interface  is  quite
intuitive,   offering  mouse  support,  Windows-like menus  and  multiple document subwindows.
    + The program saves its last used settings in a file named ABBREVV.SET, so it can automatically open the same abbrevation file windows the next time you start it.

![ABBREVV](./imgs/abbrevv.png)

+ [Acrobat Reader](./zip/acrodos.zip) - The one and only time Adobe, Inc made a PDF viewer for DOS.
    + I have taken care of the installation for you and "registered" it to "FreeDOS User".
    + You can start the program with either *acrodos* or *acrobat*: the two batch files are identical.
    + If you have graphical problems, try *acrodosu* or *acrobatu*: these load the UNIVBE driver before running Acrobat itself. Makes no difference on my system, but it might help with really old display cards.
    + Acrobat for DOS can only display PDFs built to an early specification. But there are ways to convert a modern PDF to an older version: see [here](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-convert-pdf-files-to-an-older-format) and [here](https://itstillworks.com/save-pdf-older-version-adobe-6781219.html) for some ideas on the subject.
    + in *CONFIG.SYS*, your *FILES=* statement should be at least 20. The FreeDOS default is 40, so that should not be a problem.

![Acrobat](./imgs/acrodos.png)

+ [AS-EASY-AS](./imgs/aseasy.zip) 5.7 - Spreadsheet
    + In its day, this was THE shareware competotor to Lotus 1-2-3.
    + Now freeware courtesy of Trius, Inc.
    + Packaged as registered to "FreeDOS User" with serial number already filled in (but see the LSM file if you need it for some reason).
    + Also contains the manual in PDF format.

![ASEASY](./imgs/aseasy.png)

+ [Breeze](./zip/breeze.zip) by Kevin Solway - Perhaps the most comprehensive text editor ever written for DOS.
    + Ignore all the shareware documentation: according to the [website](http://www.theabsolute.net/sware/oldfav.html) this is now freeware.

![Breeze](./imgs/breeze.gif)

+ [DataPerfect](./zip/datapfct.zip) 2.6 - A relational database.
    + DataPerfect, originally published by WordPerfect Corp, and later by Novell, was a fast, memory efficient, but capable relational database for DOS. 
    + WordPerfect Corp sold the product alongside their other DOS based office products, such as WordPerfect and PlanPerfect.
    + In 1995 Novell released DataPerfect as freeware and development was continued by its original author, Lew Bastian until about 2008.
    + **Packager's note:** I'll admit, I can't make head or tails of this program, but there are people who swear by it. You can get supporting programs and files [here](https://www.dataperfect.nl/files/).

![dataperfect](./imgs/datapfct.jpg)

+ <u>Microsoft Word</u> 5.5 - The last version for DOS of Microsoft's all-conquering word processor.
    + Released as freeware by Microsoft, Inc, supposedly as a Y2K update, but it contains the entire program.
    + Word for DOS 5.x is a dual mode MS-DOS and OS/2 application. It supports operation under 16-bit OS/2 1.x console mode.
    + Version 5.5 changes the user interface. It adds Mac/Windows features like pulldown menus and overlapping windows.
    + Packages include standalone format translators - Word<->DCA, RTF<->DCA, DOS<->Word, & more. 
    + The UK English version has the largest selection of printer drivers.
    + You can install all four if you like - they won't clash. Start the one you want with the command WORD55XX where XX is one of UK, US, DE or FR.
    + As delivered, this package has drivers for VGA and a Hewlett-Packard LaserJet printer.
    + To change these, go to the SETUP directory and run SETUP.EXE.
    + When you get to the point where it asks if you want to setup a new WORD or change an existing one, choose the second option and then in the next screen give the directory name as c:\FDOS\PROGS\WORD55XX where XX is one of UK, US, DE or FR.
    + You can also change the initial display mode (default: text-mode) in the same way.
    + Downloads:
        + [UK English](./zip/word55uk.zip)
        + [US English](./zip/word55us.zip)
        + [Deutsch](./zip/word55de.zip)

## <a name="Eyecandy"></a>Eye Candy

+ [Acid Warp 4.2](./zip/acidwarp.zip) - Run it and watch the pretty colors.
    + Free Software by [Noah Spurrier](http://www.noah.org/acidwarp/).
    + *CTRL-Break* exits the program, If your keyboard does not have a *Break* key, *CTRL-C* also works ... eventually. You may have to hit it a few times.
    + Source code included, but it is marked as "private proprietary source code" (see *ACIDWARP.C*), so I guess that is for inspiration only.

![acidwarp](./imgs/acidwarp.jpg)

+ [DeciMatrix](./zip/dcmatrix.zip) - Matrix-like screensaver.
    +  ¬© [Bruno F√©lix Rezende Ribeiro](https://oitofelix.github.io), released under GNU GPL v3.
    + DeciMatrix is a program designed to decode the Matrix into decimal.
    + It works with CGA, EGA and VGA graphic adapters and it runs on any IBM-PC compatible, the minimum requirement being an 8086 processor with 16Kb of RAM.
    + It is based on the premise that it‚Äôs easier for people to become proficient in interpreting the Matrix code if instead of dealing with very cryptic symbols rolling down in the screen, they could deal with static and familiar symbols.
    + It‚Äôs still quite hard to learn how to see through the code, though; but don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî if you happen to never see the woman in red, at least you‚Äôll have used a very cool DOS screen-saver.
    + **Packager's note**: DCMATRIX does not clean up the screen mode after it closes, so you may want to issue a MODE CO80 afterwards.

## <a name="TSR"></a>Terminate-and-stay-resident utilities

Not a priority, sorry. These things can crash your system mightlily if you invoke them while in the wrong screen mode.

Still, if and when I do find some that are sufficiently robust and useful, I will post them here.

## <a name="Tips"></a>FreeDOS Tips

These are just a few tricks that I figured out to make my life in FreeDOS a little easier.

**1. Fix the floppy drive blues.**

Who still has a computer with a floppy drive? But old DOS apps assume that it is there and will throw up error messages if you accidentally select that drive. Here's the fix:
````
MKDIR C:\FDOS\DRIVEA
MKDIR C:\FDOS\DRIVEB
````
Now include the following lines in your AUTOEXEC.BAT

````
SWSUBST A: C:\FDOS\DRIVEA
SWSUBST B: C:\FDOS\DRIVEB
````
