+ [Babble!](./zip/babble.zip) - Randomize and rearrange text.
    + Shareware from Korenthal Associates
    + Babble! is a toy for people who love words.
    + Babble! takes samples of text from various sources, analyzes them for style and content, mixes them together in varying proportions, and then...well...*babbles*.
    + On and on. Endlessly. If you take its samples away, it still babbles. That's what Babble! does. It babbles!
    + By mixing up words and ideas, and by finding connections which are not obvious to the naked mind, Babble! is useful as a creative tool and as a cure for writer's block.

    + This program is specifically designed to make self-displaying books, manuals, documents, and catalogues.
    + The difference between Bigtext and similar programs is that it can handle genuinely BIG volumes of text (up to 700kb or more) and that it creates a single, neat and convenient executable file.
    + Ignore all the shareware documentation: according to the [website](http://www.theabsolute.net/sware/oldfav.html) this is now freeware.
