+ [BigText](./zip/bigtext.zip) by Kevin Solway- Create self-displaying illustrated books & manuals.
    + A suite of programs that turns ordinary text files into self-contained, self- displaying executable files capable of displaying full colour illustrations in body of the text.
    + This program is specifically designed to make self-displaying books, manuals, documents, and catalogues.
    + The difference between Bigtext and similar programs is that it can handle genuinely BIG volumes of text (up to 700kb or more) and that it creates a single, neat and convenient executable file.
    + Ignore all the shareware documentation: according to the [website](http://www.theabsolute.net/sware/oldfav.html) this is now freeware.
