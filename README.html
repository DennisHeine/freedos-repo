<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is a repository of <a href="http://www.freedos.org/">FreeDOS</a>-compatible freeware and OSS software. Not &ldquo;abandonware&rdquo;, by which I mean that you will not find formerly commercial software here that have not been explicitly made open-source or at least freeware.</p>

<p>However, non-crippled shareware with a single nag screen at the beginning or end is fair game. Whether you are going to try to send money to a developer from thirty or forty years ago who could be dead by now is up to you.</p>

<p>Having said all that, there are a lot of little utilities from a kinder, gentler age, when people would just make their stuff available without worrying about licenses. These will be regarded as public domain until someone informs me otherwise.</p>

<p>Source code is included wherever possible.</p>

<p>This is not meant to be a conclusive collection of DOS applications. These are apps that I have tested on <em>FreeDOS 1.2</em> (on bare silicon and in the <em>DOSBox</em> emulator) and that I find useful, fun or interesting. If you need something more comprehensive, try <a href="http://reimagery.com/fsfd/">this site</a> or <a href="https://www.opus.co.tt/dave/indexall.htm">this one</a>. I am not a gamer at all, so if that is what you are looking for, well, sorry, I only have a few of the simplest ones.</p>

<p>An example: FreeDOS comes with DosZip Commander. I use it all the time. And if you don&rsquo;t like that one, it also has DOS Navigator. There are dozens of Norton Commander clones out there: Directory Maven, Volkov Commander, you name it. But generally one is only going to end up in this repository if it offers a clear difference to and advantage over Doszip Commander.</p>

<p>On a standard FreeDOS installation, Option 1 of the initial menu is
<code>
1 - Load FreeDOS with JEMMEX, no EMS (most UMBs), max RAM free
</code>
and that is the setting under which I test these programs. I have seen graphical programs, in particular, crash all too often under EMM386 in Option 2. If one of these apps absolutely requires Expanded Memory, I will document it here.</p>

<p>I may also slip in a few little apps that I wrote myself. You will know them by a certain primitive look and feel :-)</p>

<h2><a name="Installation"></a>To install these packages:</h2>

<p>Download the package, transfer it to your FreeDOS system and extract the zip file to the <strong>ROOT directory</strong> (C:\).</p>

<pre><code>unzip packagename.zip -d c:\
</code></pre>

<p>You might be tempted to use the <em>DosZip Commander</em>, which is bundled with FreeDOS and can be called up with the command <em>dz</em>, or similar utilities. I advise against this. These packages were actually created under Linux and you may come across weird crc errors if you use <em>dz</em>. The command line works fine.</p>

<p><em>It is important to extract these packages to the root directory!</em> This is different from official FreeDOS packages, wich expect to be extracted to <em>C:\FDOS</em>. There is an actual reason for this. Some of these very old programs are not relocatable: They have hardcoded paths inside them and will crash or refuse to load if you try to run them from a strange directory. I have tried really hard to stick to the FreeDOS file system and not litter your root with directories, but sometimes I simply can&rsquo;t. Better then, to have a single installation procedure for all my packages.</p>

<p>Programs that do not run directly from <em>c:\FDOS\BIN</em> will have a convenient batch file placed in <em>C:\FDOS\LINKS</em>. If a program requires changes to <em>CONFIG.SYS</em> or <em>AUTOEXEC.BAT</em>, that will be documented here.</p>

<p>Sorry, there is no uninstall facility. But most of these packages consist of a single directory in C:\FDOS\PROGS (or C:\FDOS\DEVEL), a batch file in C:\FDOS\LINKS and an information file in C:\FDOS\APPINFO, so it shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard.</p>
