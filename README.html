<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is a repository of <a href="http://www.freedos.org/">FreeDOS</a>-compatible freeware and OSS software. Not "abandonware", by which I mean that you will not find formerly commercial software here that have not been explicitly made open-source or at least freeware. </p>

<p>However, non-crippled shareware with a single nag screen at the beginning or end is fair game. Whether you are going to try to send money to a developer from thirty or forty years ago who could be dead by now is up to you.</p>

<p>Having said that, there are a lot of little utilities from a kinder, gentler age, when people would just make their stuff available without worrying about licenses. These will be regarded as public domain until someone informs me otherwise.</p>

<p>Source code is included wherever possible.</p>

<p>This is not meant to be a conclusive collection of DOS applications. These are apps that I have tested on <em>FreeDOS 1.2</em> (on bare silicon and in the <em>DOSBox</em> emulator) and that I find useful or interesting. If you need something more comprehensive, try <a href="http://reimagery.com/fsfd/">this site</a> or <a href="https://www.opus.co.tt/dave/indexall.htm">this one</a>. I am not a gamer at all, so if that is what you are looking for, well, sorry.</p>

<p>I may also slip in a few little apps that I wrote myself. You will know them by a certain primitive look and feel :-)</p>

<h2><a name="Installation"></a>To install these packages:</h2>

<p>Download the package, transfer it to your FreeDOS computer and extract the zip file to the <strong>ROOT directory</strong> (C:\). </p>

<pre><code>unzip packagename.zip -d c:\
</code></pre>

<p>You might be tempted to use the <em>DosZip Commander</em>, which is bundled with FreeDOS and can be called up with the command <em>dz</em>. I advise against this. These packages were actually created under Linux and you may come across weird crc errors if you use <em>dz</em>. The command line works fine.</p>

<p><em>It is important to extract these packages to the root directory!</em> This is different from official FreeDOS packages, wich expect to be extracted to <em>C:\FDOS</em>. There is an actual reason for this. Some of these very old programs are not relocatable: They have hardcoded paths inside them and will crash if you try to run them from a strange directory. I have tried really hard to stick to the FreeDOS file system and not litter your root with directories, but sometimes I simply can't. Better then, to have a single installation procedure for all my packages.</p>

<p>Programs that do not run directly from <em>c:\FDOS\BIN</em> will have a convenient batch file placed in <em>C:\FDOS\LINKS</em>. If a program requires changes to <em>CONFIG.SYS</em> or <em>AUTOEXEC.BAT</em>, that will be documented here. </p>

<h2><a name="Launchers"></a>Program launchers and environments</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="./zip/LCARS24.zip">LCARS24</a> - Emulates the look and feel of a certain well-known science fiction computer system.
<ul>
<li>Get your sound card working before you install this.</li>
<li>Originally from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/lcars24/">SourceForge</a>.</li>
<li>GPL v2, source included.</li>
</ul></li>

<h2><a name="Productivity"></a>Productivity applications</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="./zip/abbrevv.zip">ABBREVV</a> - A  menu-oriented DOS application to view and maintain a  list  of
abbrevations.
<ul>
<li>Freeware by J R Ferguson for non-commercial purposes.</li>
<li>Acronyms may be up to 7 characters long, the description can be any text up to 69 characters.</li>
<li>It shows one or more sorted abbrevation lists, allows you to insert, change or delete entries and search for duplicates. </li>
<li>You can also merge two or more abbrevation lists into  a  single  one.</li>
<li>The  program  interface  is  quite
intuitive,   offering  mouse  support,  Windows-like menus  and  multiple document subwindows.</li>
<li>The program saves its last used settings in a file named ABBREVV.SET, so it can automatically open the same abbrevation file windows the next time you start it.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="./imgs/abbrevv.png" alt="ABBREVV" title="" /></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="./zip/acrodos.zip">Acrobat Reader</a> - The one and only time Adobe, Inc made a PDF viewer for DOS.
<ul>
<li>I have taken care of the installation for you and "registered" it to "FreeDOS User".</li>
<li>You can start the program with either <em>acrodos</em> or <em>acrobat</em>: the two batch files are identical.</li>
<li>If you have graphical problems, try <em>acrodosu</em> or <em>acrobatu</em>: these load the UNIVBE driver before running Acrobat itself. Makes no difference on my system, but it might help with really old display cards.</li>
<li>Acrobat for DOS can only display PDFs built to an early specification. But there are ways to convert a modern PDF to an older version: see <a href="https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-convert-pdf-files-to-an-older-format">here</a> and <a href="https://itstillworks.com/save-pdf-older-version-adobe-6781219.html">here</a> for some ideas on the subject.</li>
<li>in <em>CONFIG.SYS</em>, your <em>FILES=</em> statement should be at least 20. The FreeDOS default is 40, so that should not be a problem.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<li><u>Microsoft Word</u> 5.5 - The last version for DOS of MIcrosoft's all-conquering word processor.

<li>As delivered, this package has drivers for VGA and a Hewlett-Packard LaserJet printer.</li>
<li>To change these, go to the SETUP directory and run SETUP.EXE.</li>
<li>When you get to the point where it asks if you want to setup a new WORD or change an existing one, choose the second option and then in the next screen give the directory name as c:\FDOS\PROGS\WORD55XX where XX is one of UK, US, DE or FR.</li>
