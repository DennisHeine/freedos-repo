<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is a repository of <a href="http://www.freedos.org/">FreeDOS</a>-compatible freeware and OSS software. Not "abandonware", by which I mean that you will not find formerly commercial software here that have not been explicitly made open-source or at least freeware. </p>

<p>However, non-crippled shareware with a single nag screen at the beginning or end is fair game. Whether you are going to try to send money to a developer who could be dead by now is up to you.</p>

<p>Having said that, there are a lot of little utilities from a kinder, gentler age, when people would just make their stuff available without worrying about licenses. These will be regarded as public domain until someone informs me otherwise.</p>

<p>Source code is included wherever possible.</p>

<p>This is not meant to be an conclusive collection of DOS applications. These are apps that I have tested on <em>FreeDOS 1.2</em> (on bare silicon and in the <em>DOSBox</em> emulator) and that I find useful or interesting. If you need something more comprehensive, try <a href="http://reimagery.com/fsfd/">this site</a> or <a href="https://www.opus.co.tt/dave/indexall.htm">this one</a>. I am not a gamer at all, so if that is what you are looking for, well, sorry.</p>

<p>I may also slip in a few little apps that I wrote myself. You will know them by a certain primitive look and feel :-)</p>

<h2><a name="Installation"></a>To install these packages:</h2>

<p>Download the package, transfer it to your FreeDOS computer and extract the zip file to the <strong>ROOT directory</strong> (C:\). </p>

<pre><code>unzip packagename.zip -d c:\
</code></pre>

<p>You might be tempted to use the <em>DosZip Commander</em>, which is bundled with FreeDOS and can be called up with the command <em>dz</em>. I advise against this. These packages were actually created under Linux and you may come across weird crc errors if you use <em>dz</em>. The command line works fine.</p>

<p><em>It is important to extract these packages to the root directory!</em> This is different from official FreeDOS packages, wich expect to be extracted to <em>C:\FDOS</em>. There is an actual reason for this. Some of these very old programs are not relocatable: They have hardcoded paths inside them and will crash if you try to run them from a strange directory. I have tried really hard to stick to the FreeDOS file system and not litter your root with directories, but sometimes I simply can't. Better then, to have a single installation procedure for all my packages.</p>

<p>Programs that do not run directly from <em>c:\FDOS\BIN</em> will have a convenient batch file placed in <em>C:\FDOS\LINKS</em>. If a program requires changes to <em>CONFIG.SYS</em> or <em>AUTOEXEC.BAT</em>, that will be documented here. </p>

<h2><a name="Launchers"></a>Program launchers and environments</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="./zip/LCARS24.zip">LCARS24</a> - Emulates the look and feel of a certain well-known science fiction computer system.
<ul>
<li>Get your sound card working before you install this.</li>
<li>Originally from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/lcars24/">SourceForge</a>.</li>
<li>GPL v2, source included.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Productivity"></a>Productivity applications</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="./zip/abbrevv.zip">ABBREVV</a> - A  menu-oriented DOS application to view and maintain a  list  of
abbrevations.
<ul>
<li>Freeware by J R Ferguson for non-commercial purposes.</li>
<li>Acronyms may be up to 7 characters long, the description can be any text up to 69 characters.</li>
<li>It shows one or more sorted abbrevation lists, allows you to insert, change or delete entries and search for duplicates. </li>
<li>You can also merge two or more abbrevation lists into  a  single  one.</li>
<li>The  program  interface  is  quite
intuitive,   offering  mouse  support,  Windows-like menus  and  multiple document subwindows.</li>
<li>The program saves its last used settings in a file named ABBREVV.SET, so it can automatically open the same abbrevation file windows the next time you start it.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="./imgs/abbrevv.png" alt="ABBREVV" title="" /></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="./zip/acrodos.zip">Acrobat Reader</a> - The one and only time Adobe, Inc made a PDF viewer for DOS.
<ul>
<li>I have taken care of the installation for you and "registered" it to "FreeDOS User".</li>
<li>You can start the program with either <em>acrodos</em> or <em>acrobat</em>: the two batch files are identical.</li>
<li>If you have graphical problems, try <em>acrodosu</em> or <em>acrobatu</em>: these load the UNIVBE driver before running Acrobat itself. Makes no difference on my system, but it might help with really old display cards.</li>
<li>Acrobat for DOS can only display PDFs built to an early specification. But there are ways to convert a modern PDF to an older version: see <a href="https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-convert-pdf-files-to-an-older-format">here</a> and <a href="https://itstillworks.com/save-pdf-older-version-adobe-6781219.html">here</a> for some ideas on the subject.</li>
<li>in <em>CONFIG.SYS</em>, your <em>FILES=</em> statement should be at least 20. The FreeDOS default is 40, so that should not be a problem.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="./imgs/acrodos.png" alt="Acrobat" title="" /></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="./zip/breeze.zip">Breeze</a> by Kevin Solway - Perhaps the most comprehensive text editor ever written for DOS.
<ul>
<li>Ignore all the shareware documentation: according to the <a href="http://www.theabsolute.net/sware/oldfav.html">website</a> this is now freeware.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Graphics"></a> Graphics applications</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="./zip/animator.zip">Animator</a> - (A.K.A. Autodesk Animator, Video Paint, or simply V) is a 256 color paint and animation package.
<ul>
<li>BSD licensed.</li>
<li>See the <a href="http://animatorpro.org">Home page</a> and the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/AnimatorPro/Animator-Pro">code repository</a>. </li>

<h2><a name="Development"></a>Programming languages etc.</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="./zip/turbop55.zip">Turbo Pascal 5.5</a> - Borland's last version of this language for DOS.
<ul>
<li>Freeware available from the <a href="http://edn.embarcadero.com/museum">Embarcadero Museum</a>.</li>
<li>After installation, run <em>C:\FDOS\DEVEL\TP55\TINST.EXE</em> to set it up for your system.</li>
<li>in <em>CONFIG.SYS</em>, your <em>FILES=</em> statement should be at least 20. The FreeDOS default is 40, so that should not be a problem.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Eyecandy"></a>Eye Candy</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="./zip/acidwarp.zip">Acid Warp 4.2</a> - Run it and watch the pretty colors.
<ul>
<li>Free Software by <a href="http://www.noah.org/acidwarp/">Noah Spurrier</a>.</li>
<li><em>CTRL-Break</em> exits the program, If your keyboard does not have a <em>Break</em> key, <em>CTRL-C</em> also works ... eventually. You may have to hit it a few times.</li>
<li>Source code included, but it is marked as "private proprietary source code" (see <em>ACIDWARP.C</em>), so I guess that is for inspiration only.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Commandline"></a>Command-line utilities</h2>

<li>Compiled with <em>BCC</em> under <em>FreeDOS</em> 1.2</li>
<li><em>Example output:</em>
<code>
The Arian Theosophist Sect suspects that Darwin's "Origin of Species"
if read backwards, reveals cryptic messages from the last practicing
