<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is a repository of <a href="http://www.freedos.org/">FreeDOS</a>-compatible freeware and OSS software. Not "abandonware", by which I mean that you will not find formerly commercial software here that have not been explicitly made open-source or at least freeware. </p>

<p>However, non-crippled shareware with a single nag screen at the beginning or end is fair game. Whether you are going to try to send money to a developer from thirty or forty years ago who could be dead by now is up to you.</p>

<p>Having said that, there are a lot of little utilities from a kinder, gentler age, when people would just make their stuff available without worrying about licenses. These will be regarded as public domain until someone informs me otherwise.</p>

<p>Source code is included wherever possible.</p>

<p>This is not meant to be a conclusive collection of DOS applications. These are apps that I have tested on <em>FreeDOS 1.2</em> (on bare silicon and in the <em>DOSBox</em> emulator) and that I find useful, fun or interesting. If you need something more comprehensive, try <a href="http://reimagery.com/fsfd/">this site</a> or <a href="https://www.opus.co.tt/dave/indexall.htm">this one</a>. I am not a gamer at all, so if that is what you are looking for, well, sorry, I only have a few of the simplest ones.</p>

<p>On a standard FreeDOS installation, Option 1 of the initial menu is
<code>
1 - Load FreeDOS with JEMMEX, no EMS (most UMBs), max RAM free
</code>
and that is the setting under which I test these programs. I have seen graphical programs, in particular, crash all too often under EMM386 in Option 2. If one of these apps absolutely requires Expanded Memory, I will document it here.</p>

<p>I may also slip in a few little apps that I wrote myself. You will know them by a certain primitive look and feel :-)</p>

<h2><a name="Installation"></a>To install these packages:</h2>

<p>Download the package, transfer it to your FreeDOS system and extract the zip file to the <strong>ROOT directory</strong> (C:\). </p>

<pre><code>unzip packagename.zip -d c:\
</code></pre>

<p>You might be tempted to use the <em>DosZip Commander</em>, which is bundled with FreeDOS and can be called up with the command <em>dz</em>, or similar utilities. I advise against this. These packages were actually created under Linux and you may come across weird crc errors if you use <em>dz</em>. The command line works fine.</p>

<p><em>It is important to extract these packages to the root directory!</em> This is different from official FreeDOS packages, wich expect to be extracted to <em>C:\FDOS</em>. There is an actual reason for this. Some of these very old programs are not relocatable: They have hardcoded paths inside them and will crash or refuse to load if you try to run them from a strange directory. I have tried really hard to stick to the FreeDOS file system and not litter your root with directories, but sometimes I simply can't. Better then, to have a single installation procedure for all my packages.</p>

<p>Programs that do not run directly from <em>c:\FDOS\BIN</em> will have a convenient batch file placed in <em>C:\FDOS\LINKS</em>. If a program requires changes to <em>CONFIG.SYS</em> or <em>AUTOEXEC.BAT</em>, that will be documented here. </p>

<p>Sorry, there is no uninstall facility. But most of these packages consist of a single directory in C:\FDOS\PROGS (or C:\FDOS\DEVEL), a batch file in C:\FDOS\LINKS and an information file in C:\FDOS\APPINFO, so it shouldn't be too hard.</p>

<h2><a name="Launchers"></a>Program launchers, file managers and environments</h2>

<ul>
<li><u>Access</u> (aka <u>XX</u>) - A menu program. It runs your applications and games.
<ul>
<li>Freeware by Ronald Blankendaal.</li>
<li>Access is especially suitable for people that are still using DOS, but do not endorse the command prompt and its limitations.</li>
<li>Access tries to overcome its most important annoyances. For example, in DOS, when a user wants to run a program, he or she would have to move to the appropriate directory on the disk first. Access will search for a program's location fully automatically.</li>
<li>Another important feature of Access is its simple user-friendly interface.</li>
<li>Straightforward, good-looking and customizable.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Version 3.01</strong>
<ul>
<li>This version is non-graphical and works fine on a 8088!</li>
<li>Packager's note: this is the one I use myself.</li>
<li><strong>Downloads:</strong>
<ul>
<li><a href="./zip/xx3en.zip">English</a></li>
<li><a href="./zip/xx3nl.zip">Nederlands</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="./imgs/xx301.gif" alt="access301" title="" />  </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Version 4.60</strong>
<ul>
<li>This is a complete rewrite and uses a graphical rather than a text interface.</li>
<li>It comes with a large collection of icons and Windows icons can be added with a standalone program.</li>
<li><strong>Downloads:</strong>
<ul>
<li><a href="./zip/xx4en.zip">English</a></li>
<li><a href="./zip/xx4nl.zip">Nederlands</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="./imgs/xx460.gif" alt="access301" title="" /></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Version 5.0</strong>
<ul>
<li>Packager's note: Pre-release versions of Access v5 exist. I find them too buggy to package, but if you want to try, it can be downloaded at <a href="http://members.quicknet.nl/blankendaalr/">http://members.quicknet.nl/blankendaalr/</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The following features are shared by all Access versions.</p>

<ul>
<li>Takes no memory while running programs! No matter whether you start a program directly from DOS or from within Access, you will have exactly the same amount of conventional memory left.</li>
<li>Can store an unlimited number or programs and program groups, only limited by the amount of available free memory.</li>
<li>Has full mouse support.</li>
<li>Has an advanced feature called 'QuickKey' that can help you search for a program in the menu.</li>
<li>Supports both English and Dutch (Nederlands) in full.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><a href="./zip/LCARS24.zip">LCARS24</a> - Emulates the look and feel of a certain well-known science fiction computer system.</p>

<ul>
<li>Get your sound card working before you install this.</li>

<h2><a name="Productivity"></a>Productivity applications</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="./zip/abbrevv.zip">ABBREVV</a> - A  menu-oriented DOS application to view and maintain a  list  of
abbrevations.
<ul>
<li>Freeware by J R Ferguson for non-commercial purposes.</li>
<li>Acronyms may be up to 7 characters long, the description can be any text up to 69 characters.</li>
<li>It shows one or more sorted abbrevation lists, allows you to insert, change or delete entries and search for duplicates. </li>
<li>You can also merge two or more abbrevation lists into  a  single  one.</li>
<li>The  program  interface  is  quite
intuitive,   offering  mouse  support,  Windows-like menus  and  multiple document subwindows.</li>
<li>The program saves its last used settings in a file named ABBREVV.SET, so it can automatically open the same abbrevation file windows the next time you start it.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="./imgs/abbrevv.png" alt="ABBREVV" title="" /></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="./zip/acrodos.zip">Acrobat Reader</a> - The one and only time Adobe, Inc made a PDF viewer for DOS.
<ul>
<li>I have taken care of the installation for you and "registered" it to "FreeDOS User".</li>
<li>You can start the program with either <em>acrodos</em> or <em>acrobat</em>: the two batch files are identical.</li>
<li>If you have graphical problems, try <em>acrodosu</em> or <em>acrobatu</em>: these load the UNIVBE driver before running Acrobat itself. Makes no difference on <em>my</em> system, but it might help with really old display cards.</li>
<li>Acrobat for DOS can only display PDFs built to an early specification. But there are ways to convert a modern PDF to an older version: see <a href="https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-convert-pdf-files-to-an-older-format">here</a> and <a href="https://itstillworks.com/save-pdf-older-version-adobe-6781219.html">here</a> for some ideas on the subject. Or you can use <a href="#dospdf">DOSPDF</a>.</li>
<li>in <em>CONFIG.SYS</em>, your <em>FILES=</em> statement should be at least 20. The FreeDOS default is 40, so that should not be a problem.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><a href="./zip/datapfct.zip">DataPerfect</a> 2.6 - A relational database.
<ul>
<li>DataPerfect, originally published by WordPerfect Corp, and later by Novell, was a fast, memory efficient, but capable relational database for DOS. </li>
<li>WordPerfect Corp sold the product alongside their other DOS based office products, such as WordPerfect and PlanPerfect.</li>
<li>In 1995 Novell released DataPerfect as freeware and development was continued by its original author, Lew Bastian until about 2008.</li>

<li>As delivered, this package has drivers for VGA and a Hewlett-Packard LaserJet printer.</li>
<li>To change these, go to the SETUP directory and run SETUP.EXE.</li>
<li>When you get to the point where it asks if you want to setup a new WORD or change an existing one, choose the second option and then in the next screen give the directory name as c:\FDOS\PROGS\WORD55XX where XX is one of UK, US, DE or FR.</li>

<p>Most of these will end up in C:\FDOS\BIN. <strong>Please note</strong> that there are only so many filenames available when you have just eight characters to play with. You may already have a utility with the same name. If UNZIP asks whether to overwrite a file, think very carefully whether you want to use this file rather than the default FreeDOS one.

<h2><a name="Tips"></a>FreeDOS Tips</h2>

<p>These are just a few tricks that I figured out to make my life in FreeDOS a little easier.</p>

<p><strong>1. Fix the floppy drive blues.</strong></p>

<p>Who still has a computer with a floppy drive? But old DOS apps assume that it is there and will throw up error messages if you accidentally select that drive. Here's the fix:
<code>
MKDIR C:\FDOS\DRIVEA
MKDIR C:\FDOS\DRIVEB
</code>
Now include the following lines in your AUTOEXEC.BAT</p>

<p><code>
SWSUBST A: C:\FDOS\DRIVEA
SWSUBST B: C:\FDOS\DRIVEB
</code></p>
