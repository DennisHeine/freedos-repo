NOTE: These programs are NOT memory-resident. They are regular .COM or .EXE programs.

+ [Acid Warp 4.2](./zip/acidwarp.zip) - Run it and watch the pretty colors.
    + Free Software by [Noah Spurrier](http://www.noah.org/acidwarp/).
    + *CTRL-Break* exits the program, If your keyboard does not have a *Break* key, *CTRL-C* also works ... eventually. You may have to hit it a few times.
    + Source code included, but it is marked as "private proprietary source code" (see *ACIDWARP.C*), so I guess that is for inspiration only.

+ [DeciMatrix](./zip/dcmatrix.zip) - Matrix-like screensaver.
    +  © [Bruno Félix Rezende Ribeiro](https://oitofelix.github.io), released under GNU GPL v3.
    + DeciMatrix is a program designed to decode the Matrix into decimal.
    + It works with CGA, EGA and VGA graphic adapters and it runs on any IBM-PC compatible, the minimum requirement being an 8086 processor with 16Kb of RAM.
    + It is based on the premise that it’s easier for people to become proficient in interpreting the Matrix code if instead of dealing with very cryptic symbols rolling down in the screen, they could deal with static and familiar symbols.
    + It’s still quite hard to learn how to see through the code, though; but don’t worry — if you happen to never see the woman in red, at least you’ll have used a very cool DOS screen-saver.
    + **Packager's note**: DCMATRIX does not clean up the screen mode after it closes, so you may want to issue a MODE CO80 afterwards.
