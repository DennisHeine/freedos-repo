NOTE: These programs are NOT memory-resident. They are regular .COM or .EXE programs. You may need to run a utility to slow your system down to use some of these. 

+ [Acid Warp 4.2](./zip/acidwarp.zip) - Run it and watch the pretty colors.
    + Free Software by [Noah Spurrier](http://www.noah.org/acidwarp/).
    + *CTRL-Break* exits the program, If your keyboard does not have a *Break* key, *CTRL-C* also works ... eventually. You may have to hit it a few times.
    + Source code included, but it is marked as "private proprietary source code" (see *ACIDWARP.C*), so I guess that is for inspiration only.
    + [DIAL8](./zip/dial8.zip) is a tweaked version of Acid Warp.

+ [BClock](./zip/bclock.zip) - An almost analog clock
    + by Olle Olsson

![Bclock](./imgs/bclock.png)

+ [BigClock](./zip/bigclock.zip) - Two different ways to turn your computer into a fullscreen digital clock
    + Public Domain (?) by Jorgen Dybdahl.
    + [Arthur](./zip/arthur.zip) is a similar program.

+ [DeciMatrix](./zip/dcmatrix.zip) - Matrix-like screensaver.
    +  © [Bruno Félix Rezende Ribeiro](https://oitofelix.github.io), released under GNU GPL v3.
    + DeciMatrix is a program designed to decode the Matrix into decimal.
    + It works with CGA, EGA and VGA graphic adapters and it runs on any IBM-PC compatible, the minimum requirement being an 8086 processor with 16Kb of RAM.
    + It is based on the premise that it’s easier for people to become proficient in interpreting the Matrix code if instead of dealing with very cryptic symbols rolling down in the screen, they could deal with static and familiar symbols.
    + It’s still quite hard to learn how to see through the code, though; but don’t worry — if you happen to never see the woman in red, at least you’ll have used a very cool DOS screen-saver.
    + **Packager's note**: DCMATRIX does not clean up the screen mode after it closes, so you may want to issue a MODE CO80 afterwards.

+ [Fractint](./zip/fractint.zip) - Fractal generating program.
    + Definitely not a screensaver!

![fractint](./imgs/fractint.png)

+ [Hiver](./zip/hiver.zip) - animated winter scene screensaver.
    + Freeware by Martin Savage.
    + Please see the documentation - you may need to slow this one down on modern hardware.

![hiver](./imgs/hiver.png)

+ [Laser](./zip/laser.zip) - Possibly the original screensaver that has since appeared on every possible operating system.
    + Public Domain (?) by John Horemans. 
    + Turbo Pascal code included

![laser](./imgs/laser.png)

+ [Rave](./zip/rave.zip) 1.1 - Kaleidoscope emulator.
    + Generates and displays kaleidoscopic patterns with color palette "cycling" on 80x86 class computers equipped with VGA or SVGA graphics adapters and displays.
    + In addition to the default automatic mode, limited user interaction is available via the keyboard to control various drawing parameters.
    + Crashes when run from a launcher, and the video hardware detection is not great (doesn't do VESA), but you can override it with -v switches.
    + Freeware by J Ashley Roeckelein.

![rave](./imgs/rave.png)

+ [Scroller](./zip/scroller.zip) - Science-fiction-themed eye candy by Micael Dahlquist.

![Scroller](./imgs/scroller.png)

+ [Starfield](./zip/sf.zip) - Another classic, the one with stars coming at you.
    +  By Christian & Behnaz.
    + Displays Star Trek/Starwars moving space travel backgrounds on an EGA/VGA.
    + You can vary some of the parameters while the program is running by either using the mouse or the keyboard.

![starfield](./imgs/sf.png)

+ [Stary's screensavers](./zip/strss.zip) - A collection of five screensavers in EXE format.
    + BULGE, DOTTY, FLAMES, FURNACE and STRFIELD. 
    + Can also be used in DOS NAVIGATOR: see the documentation.
    + Freeware by Wojciech Dzierzanowski.
    + If you like these, you can get some more [right here](./zip/moress.zip).

![strss](./imgs/strss.png)

+ [TimeBox](./zip/timebox.zip) - Time and date display screensaver.
    + Author unknown.

![timebox](./imgs/timebox.png)

+ [VGA Art](./zip/vgaart.zip) - More demo than screensaver, with annoying ad screens at both ends.
