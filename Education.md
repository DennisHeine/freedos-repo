+ [Workbook](./zip/wrkbk.zip) 1.0 - Typing game with time limits.
    + The Child is presented with  words  and sentences to a background of an OUT OF FOCUS PCX IMAGE and must correctly OVERTYPE the WORDS within a TIME LIMIT.
    + If the SCHEDULE IS  MET,  THE  PICTURE  is  PRESENTED again, this time IN FOCUS, and a MUSICAL REWARD is PLAYED for the Timely Scholar.
    + If THE DEADLINE is NOT Met, a rude noise is  made  and  the  next  OUT  OF  FOCUS  and  WORDS COMBO is presented for another TIMED ROUND OF PLAY.
    + TIME LIMITS suddenly become imminent when our children start school, and  deadlines  can  be as important to learn as the other  more  cerebral  academic  pursuits.   Often   a   well completed  assignment  is  not so well received when received late.
    + Shareware by Bill Buckels.
