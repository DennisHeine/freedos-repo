+ <u>Access</u> (aka <u>XX</u>) - A menu program. It runs your applications and games.
    + Freeware by Ronald Blankendaal.
    + Access is especially suitable for people that are still using DOS, but do not endorse the command prompt and its limitations.
    + Access tries to overcome its most important annoyances. For example, in DOS, when a user wants to run a program, he or she would have to move to the appropriate directory on the disk first. Access will search for a program's location fully automatically.
    + Another important feature of Access is its simple user-friendly interface.
    + Straightforward, good-looking and customizable.
+ **Version 3.01**
    + This version is non-graphical and works fine on a 8088!
    + Packager's note: this is the one I use myself.
    + **Downloads:**
        + [English](./zip/xx3en.zip)
        + [Nederlands](./zip/xx3nl.zip)

+ **Version 4.60**
    + This is a complete rewrite and uses a graphical rather than a text interface.
    + It comes with a large collection of icons and Windows icons can be added with a standalone program.
    + **Downloads:**
        + [English](./zip/xx4en.zip)
        + [Nederlands](./zip/xx4nl.zip)

+ **Version 5.0**
    + Packager's note: Pre-release versions of Access v5 exist. I find them too buggy to package, but if you want to try, it can be downloaded at [http://members.quicknet.nl/blankendaalr/](http://members.quicknet.nl/blankendaalr/)
+ The following features are shared by all Access versions.
    + Takes no memory while running programs! No matter whether you start a program directly from DOS or from within Access, you will have exactly the same amount of conventional memory left.
    + Can store an unlimited number or programs and program groups, only limited by the amount of available free memory.
    + Has full mouse support.
    + Has an advanced feature called 'QuickKey' that can help you search for a program in the menu.
    + Supports both English and Dutch (Nederlands) in full.

+ [LCARS24](./zip/LCARS24.zip) - Emulates the look and feel of a certain well-known science fiction computer system.
    + Get your sound card working before you install this.
    + Originally from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lcars24/).
    + GPL v2, source included.
