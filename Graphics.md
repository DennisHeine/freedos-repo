+ [GrafX2](./zip/grafx2.zip) 2.0 beta 96.5%. - 256-colour bitmap editor.
    + Released as shareware, but the source was [GPL'ed a year later](https://web.archive.org/web/20071213221524/http://code.google.com/p/grafx2/wiki/FreeSoftwareRelease).
    + Lots of hotkeys, all reconfigurable with GFXCFG.EXE.
    + The batch file \FDOS\LINKS\GRAFX2.BAT defaults to a resolution that works well with my 1024X600 laptop screen. If that does not work for you, run GRFX2 /? from the program directory and change the "32" on the last line of the batch file to something that does.
    + You can also change the resolution inside the program. If you hit an unsupported resolution and get a screen full of gibberish, SHIFT-ENTER gets you back to a safe default.
