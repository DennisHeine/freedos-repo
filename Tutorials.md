+ [ADA Tutor](./zip/adatutor.zip) - Tutorial for the ADA language.
    + Shareware by Software Innovations Technology.
    + You don't need an Ada compiler to run ADA-TUTR on a PC, but there are two things you should do before starting the program.
    + First, the PRINT.ME file contains 54 pages of notes that should be printed.
    + Second, you need to install ANSI.SYS (which came with DOS) before running ADA-TUTR. (Packager's Note: This is done by the ANSITUTOR.BAT file in this package, but keep in mind that NANSI.SYS will be in memory afterwards.
