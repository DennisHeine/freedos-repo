Collated collections of example code published in various computer hobbyist magazines in the 1980s and 1990s, mostly scavenged from old shareware CD-ROMs. These code snippets are both of historic interest and may still be useful to current FreeDOS enthusiasts.

Install these collections like any other of my packages (see the [main page](README.md) for details). They will then be available in \FDOS\SOURCE. For example, you will find code from PC Magazine in \FDOS\SOURCE\PCMAGSRC. The vast majority of these files are in plain ASCII text format and can be viewed with a text editor or viewer. Or with the appropriate IDE, of course. In some cases, a precompiled executable is also included and a few will have to be unzipped before they can be used.

The copyright status of these documents is usually unclear, but if you are the copyright owner and you object to your material being made available like this (even after having been widely disseminated on shareware CD-ROMs for thirty years!), please let me know and I will take them down.

Please note that these packages have no LSM file in the APPINFO folder.
