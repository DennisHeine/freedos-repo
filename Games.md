Prepare to be disappointed. I am not a gamer AT ALL and I only put a few of the most simple little games up here. This is the least developed section of the repository and probably always will be.

+ [Mine Mayhem](./zip/minemay.zip)  - Minesweeper clone.
    + Freeware by Jason Hood.

+ [ShuffleV](./zip/shufflev.zip) 1.1 - Tile shuffling game.
    + Freeware for non-commercial purposes by J R Ferguson.
    + Click a number joining the empty field to shift it, or use the cursor keys.
    + Order  the numbers from low to high, in rows left to right and columns top to bottom. The empty field must be in the lower-right corner.

+ [Towers of Hani](./zip/hanoi.zip) 1.3 
    + Freeware by J R Ferguson
    + A classical recursive algorithm for which a  'legend'  was thought  up.  In Hanoi there would be monks that have a sheer inhuman task: Nine stone disks, all with a different diameter and a hole in  the  middle, are  piled on a pole, the smallest op top. Two more poles are placed beside it. The task consists  of  moving  all  disks  from  the  leftmost  to  the rightmost pole, using the middle pole as a place to store disks in-between.
    + There are two rules that must be observed:
        + Only one disk can be moved at a time.
        + Never place a disk on top of one that is smaller.
    + According to the legend, the world will be at end when this task is done.
