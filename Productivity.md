+ [ABBREVV](./zip/abbrevv.zip) - A  menu-oriented DOS application to view and maintain a  list  of
abbrevations.
    + Freeware by J R Ferguson for non-commercial purposes.
    + Acronyms may be up to 7 characters long, the description can be any text up to 69 characters.
    + It shows one or more sorted abbrevation lists, allows you to insert, change or delete entries and search for duplicates. 
    + You can also merge two or more abbrevation lists into  a  single  one.
    + The  program  interface  is  quite
intuitive,   offering  mouse  support,  Windows-like menus  and  multiple document subwindows.
    + The program saves its last used settings in a file named ABBREVV.SET, so it can automatically open the same abbrevation file windows the next time you start it.

+ [Acrobat Reader](./zip/acrodos.zip) - The one and only time Adobe, Inc made a PDF viewer for DOS.
    + I have taken care of the installation for you and "registered" it to "FreeDOS User".
    + You can start the program with either *acrodos* or *acrobat*: the two batch files are identical.
    + If you have graphical problems, try *acrodosu* or *acrobatu*: these load the UNIVBE driver before running Acrobat itself. Makes no difference on *my* system, but it might help with really old display cards.
    + Acrobat for DOS can only display PDFs built to an early specification. But there are ways to convert a modern PDF to an older version: see [here](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-convert-pdf-files-to-an-older-format) and [here](https://itstillworks.com/save-pdf-older-version-adobe-6781219.html) for some ideas on the subject. Or you can use DOSPDF, which you will find in the [command line section](Commandline.md).
    + in *CONFIG.SYS*, your *FILES=* statement should be at least 20. The FreeDOS default is 40, so that should not be a problem.

+ [Ample Notice](./zip/an2.zip) 2.04 - An appointments calendar/alarm clock package that can help organize your life.
    + Shareware by Mark Harris.
    + You enter appointments and notes in any of a variety of natural formats.
    + You can specify that a birthday occurs each July 17, or that you have a meeting every other Tuesday at 4:00 for 5 meetings, or that Father's Day is the third Sunday in June.
    + Appointments which include a time can automatically set a 'pop-up alarm clock' which notifies you at a given advance interval.
    + Different categories of appointments can be tracked for preparation of group meetings or for summaries of specific activities.
    + The sorting and archiving options let you keep track of past activities for business purposes.  Searching for a given appointment (future or past) is fast and easy.
    + Ample Notice is easy to use right away, but is powerful enough to handle a variety of complex applications.
    + Also included is a program for addressing envelopes sideways from data on the screen or from a file.

+ <u>Microsoft Word</u> 5.5 - The last version for DOS of Microsoft's all-conquering word processor.
    + Released as freeware by Microsoft, Inc, supposedly as a Y2K update, but it contains the entire program.
    + Word for DOS 5.x is a dual mode MS-DOS and OS/2 application. It supports operation under 16-bit OS/2 1.x console mode.

    + Packages include standalone format translators - Word<->DCA, RTF<->DCA, DOS<->Word, & more. 
    + The UK English version has the largest selection of printer drivers.
    + You can install all four if you like - they won't clash. Start the one you want with the command WORD55XX where XX is one of UK, US, DE or FR.
    + As delivered, this package has drivers for VGA and a Hewlett-Packard LaserJet printer.
    + To change these, go to the SETUP directory and run SETUP.EXE.
    + When you get to the point where it asks if you want to setup a new WORD or change an existing one, choose the second option and then in the next screen give the directory name as c:\FDOS\PROGS\WORD55XX where XX is one of UK, US, DE or FR.
    + You can also change the initial display mode (default: text-mode) in the same way.
