Not a priority, sorry. These things can crash your system mightily if you invoke them while in the wrong screen mode.

Still, if and when I do find some that are sufficiently robust and useful, I will post them here.

+ [ClockOn](./zip/clockon.zip) - Screen Resident Clock

    + There are a lot of little TSRs to print the time in the top-left corner of your screen. CLOCKON is the best at going away in graphics mode, then coming back in text mode again - it  will  not  write  if the screen is in any graphics mode or 40 column mode.
    + Up to nine alarms, which work even if CLOCKON is not visible.
    + Works fine from high memory with LH.
    + The author (H.J. Harvey) says there is an incompatibility with MS Word 5. I have not replicated this error in MS Word 5.5.
